> **Regnum Mortis Studios presents the highly anticipated project: Brotherhood Under the Bridge.**

## 🌉 About the Project

**Brotherhood Under the Bridge** is a title that explores life in extreme poverty and the harsh reality of battling addiction to drugs and alcohol. The game focuses on a deep narrative layer, forcing the player to make difficult moral choices in a world that has long forgotten the meaning of mercy.

Our team is working day and night to deliver a product that combines a high-quality story with engaging gameplay mechanics.

### Key Features:
* **Uncompromising Realism:** A raw look at the lives of the homeless and social outcasts.
* **Psychological Depth:** Gameplay mechanics that reflect the impact of addiction on the protagonist's mind and body.
* **Branching Narrative:** A multi-threaded story where every decision carries weight and consequence.
